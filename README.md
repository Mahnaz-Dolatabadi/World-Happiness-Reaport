# World-Happiness-Reaport
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report data for the years 2018 and 2019 to explore trends and compare happiness scores between countries. Using Power BI, I visualized various aspects of happiness, including changes in scores and contributing factors, to provide insights into what influences happiness across different countries.
Project Overview
This analysis leverages data from the World Happiness Report, which ranks countries by happiness score based on several key factors, such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

The objectives of this project are:

To compare happiness scores between 2018 and 2019.
To visualize changes in happiness scores by country.
To explore relationships between happiness and key influencing factors.

Dataset
The dataset includes happiness scores and rankings for various countries in 2018 and 2019. The key columns are:

Country: Name of the country.
Score: Happiness score of the country.
GDP per capita: Economic factor.
Social support: Measure of social connections.
Healthy life expectancy: Indicator of health and well-being.
Freedom to make life choices: Measure of freedom in decision-making.
Generosity: Measure of generosity in society.
Perceptions of corruption: Indicator of corruption in society.

Analysis and Visualizations
1. Average Happiness Scores (2018 vs. 2019)
The average happiness scores for 2018 and 2019 are displayed at the top of the dashboard to provide a quick comparison of the overall happiness trend over the two years.

2. Min, Max, and Average Scores by Year
A bar chart shows the minimum, maximum, and average happiness scores for each year. This chart provides insight into the range of happiness scores, showing the highest and lowest scores in each year and how they compare.

3. Happiness Scores and Change by Country
A table lists countries with their happiness scores for both years and the change in score from 2018 to 2019. This allows for an easy comparison of how happiness has shifted for each country.

4. Influencing Factors by Country
A series of small multiple bar charts visualize contributing factors (Generosity, Freedom, Healthy Life Expectancy, GDP per capita) for each country. This allows for an examination of how these factors relate to happiness scores and how they vary across countries.

5. Comparison of Happiness Scores by Country
A clustered bar chart compares happiness scores for 2018 and 2019 for each country and shows the change in score. This provides a visual indication of whether a country's happiness score has increased or decreased over time.

Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of global happiness trends and the contributing factors that influence happiness across countries. By exploring the data visually, we can gain insights into the complex interactions between economic, social, and health factors that impact happiness.
